# PivotHub

A simple way to integrate GitHub Issues into Pivotal Tracker

## NOTICE: I haven't used Tracker in over a year, so this project is dead. I'm not actively looking for a new maintainer, but if you want to take over, you're more than welcome.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/jrostand/pivothub.git
  ```

2. Get an OAuth key from GitHub. Instructions are available [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-oauth-token-for-command-line-use)

3. Set up your deployment environment. I use [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) personally (because you get SSL for free), but it should work equally well with other providers. Note that using SSL is highly recommended as otherwise your credentials will be transmitted in the clear.

  ```shell
  cp config.json.example config.json
  ```
  You'll need to edit `config.json` to suit your needs. Explanations of the flags are in the file.

4. Deploy it!

## Setting up Pivotal Tracker
